# Bacteria_to_Beef
Using HTML, Javascript and Plotly to retrieve data and create interactive visualizations

## Overview
We were tasked with creating a webpage to dynamically display testing data for a company researching different bacteria types found in individuals belly buttons.

## Results
By utilizing javascript and our data set we were able to create a webpage which was nicely formatted and able to display the data we were looking for by integrating a bar chart, bubble chart, and guage chart to better show the data being researched. This included being able to search the dataset by ID number in order to display the graphs relevant to that subject. In addition we used images and other styling elements to create an unique dashboard for the website
